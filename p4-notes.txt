V2: Fix BNode to have quantity
-if you have 1 node, you have at least 1 quantity
-if quantity=0, best remove it
-if they are the same, add to quantity

V3: Implement parsing of quantities from the input
-if Fraction is equal in data, add each others quantity

V4: When you delete a node, it should subtract from the quantity
-do not delink null unless final quantity is 0, otherwise subtract quantity

V5: Install the cross section
- create new class
- Fraction array
- each cell in the array is a SBT

V6: clean main program and fully implement cross section

V7: incorporate stack
- implement into cross section class?
- one stack for every tree

V8: install Scanner
- run with data from V4

v9: add unit to fraction
- modify node
- all classes except stack are modified to work with units
